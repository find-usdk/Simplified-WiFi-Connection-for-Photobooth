This is only working under Windows and is made to work together with https://github.com/photobooth-app/photobooth-app

I thought it should be possible to start the Photobooth in a way that allows the user to easily connect it to WiFi before launching the Photobooth itself.
It automatically scans for all available networks and then provides an option to enter the WiFi password and connect. At the bottom, you can see whether it is connected or not.
Once itâ€™s connected, you can easily proceed to the Photobooth.

Take a look in the demo video: https://youtube.com/shorts/Aa4wyDOeO00
